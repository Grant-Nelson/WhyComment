# Why Comment

This is a simple test for anyone who believes that code is "self documenting".

[frequency.go](./frequency.go) is the entry point for this library.
Frequency takes in a stream of information and determines something about that information.

I removed the commenting and documentation from [frequency.go](./frequency.go).
I left the comments in the other files and haven't changed the function names.
None of the code has been changed, so it should be "self explanatory", right?

The goal is for you to read the code and try to figure out what this does.
As in, what does it determine about the information?
Keep track of how long it took for you to figure it out.

DO NOT read the [Solution.md](./solution.md) until you think you have it
all figured out. Then see if the comments that were removed match what
you think this code does.

Good luck
